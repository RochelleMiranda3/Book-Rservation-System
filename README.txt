Book Reservation System

Welcome to the Book Reservation System! 

What the project does?
The Book Reservation System is an online platform designed to streamline the process of book reservations within the Batangas State University-The National Engineering University-Lipa Campus Library. It consists of three main user roles namely as student, librarian, and admin.

Student: Can log in, view a list of available books, search for specific titles, description, author and see the status of their reservations.

Librarian: Manages book reservations, approves pending requests, sets return dates, and oversees transaction history.

Admin: Has the authority to add users, manage librarians, manipulate book data, and access transaction records.

Why the project is useful

This system simplifies the book reservation process, providing a centralized platform for students, librarians, and administrators. It enhances efficiency, reduces manual workload, and ensures a smooth transaction flow.
